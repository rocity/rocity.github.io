# I ran out of adjectives to describe this project, sorry.

All the tickets on my project have been moved to the `DONE` column! Surprise!

I even created a `release` for it. I know, crazy, right? Meh. I just ran out of things to do (in conjunction with the adjective issue).

It kinda looks real with the release tag though. Ha ha!

## What now?

Finishing the first iteration of the project (I consider this the *MVP* if the app) opens up the door for the promised **video tutorial series**.
I might be able to make time to produce this this weekend. Can't be too lazy, buddy.

Do I look like I'm rushing things? I know, I don't even think too long about this. This might bring embarassment or whatever, but I ran out of f***s about it too.

*I'm running out of stuff, all of a sudden. Dang.*

I still have work to do until the work week comes to halt. Maybe I'll squeeze in some ideas to implement for the next iteration of the app when I get the chance. *Watch out for v0.2!*

## That's it!

Nothing more to code until the next iteration. Next task is video production. Catcha later.
