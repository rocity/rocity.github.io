# Two tickets left.

My target completion date on the blog app was yesterday, but issues popped up and I kinda had to move it.

I wasn't able to get up from my dusty sleeping roll for the entire weekend. The only thing I was able to do was to binge watch FMA. Very productive.

I tried doing the "Blog Create Post Page" and managed to get myself stuck on a missing `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute on my form element, and that thing made me give up after 3 mins. Brotip: Avoid catching the flu. I still can't gather enough energy to focus on anything 'til the time of writing this.

# Updates

I managed to squash 2 tickets after work. An author can now create blog posts via the dashboard. Another one is the "post category list" page that has the worst layout you'll ever find in the history of web dev. I'll probably patch that up together with the next ticket.

There're 2 tickets left, these could probably be done in less that an hour, but I'm all out of brain juice after a day of client work.
