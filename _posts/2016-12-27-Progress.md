For some time, I've wrote macro scripts for AIs in a dark room, alone thinking about how I can outsmart a broken system. Sniggering about how I'm going to be richer above my friends with virtual currency on a game.


That must be the start of it all.


I would sit alone on a bench with my tiny computer inside the campus grounds writing scripts for a pet project. Scribbling on a pad of paper of ideas popping inside that brain of mine. What if I do it like this, what if I do it like that?

I was falling inlove with it. But I didn't recognize that yet.

These days, I work side-by-side with a number of CTOs, whom I never expected to even receive a simple "Hello" from. I may be slow in progress, but I am hopeful. I still haven't figured out how to utilize this hope. My potential is just waiting there in a corner, impatient to be awakened.

I've walked far. I guess I need to walk more and figure things out along the way. It's the journey that matters, right?
