## The beginning of a bad idea.

As I write this post, I'm already 6 commits deep into **yet another BLOG application**. Currently prototyping/spiking it up, I expect it to be complete this weekend with complete functionality. (You can watch my progress [here](https://github.com/rocity/blogger/projects/1).)

## Why on earth would you create another Blog app, Kevin? Are you that sadistic towards hurting yourself?

This morning, I got sick of (quite literally) writing my workout results on a spreadsheet file.

Spreadsheets are boring. I want an app. I decided that I'm going to build an Android app (nope, not gonna happen. you're a lazy bum) to record my results.

So I downloaded these tutorials on youtube on how to build an Android app. Watching it was so boring, I was gonna jump out of our 2nd floor apartment's balcony (sorry Bucky).

## Get to the point already.

So yeah, watching those tutorials made me want to create tutorials of my own. And so here we are, creating a Blog app, where we can create tutorials about. Maybe I'll be able to materialize this thing, or not...
Maybe I should be more positive about this.

Just wanted to put this here for the record. That I may yet again fail on another attempt to do anything with my time. Oh well.

## Stay tuned!

The project's code is on [this](https://github.com/rocity/blogger/) page.

It's licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/rocity/blogger/blob/develop/LICENSE), there's that. Just google about what the license thingy does. You'll get it.

*I'll probably write another post on the weekend.*

*TL;DR: I'm creating a blog app to showcase on a blog app creation tutorial*
