## Unproductive days are pure sadness.

It's frustrating not being able to do anything even just for a single hour.
I had a senior who loved the phrase "Life is like riding a bicycle. You have to keep moving.".

Thanks captain, no shit?

The rainy season must have caught up to me atlast, had to call in sick today thanks to a sore throat, a cold and an overall useless body.

I just slept for the whole day until darkness fell. fml.

## Had to compensate

I wrote about the blog app I was building yesterday, and I was able touch some tickets from a solid 3 hours of coding. Whoah!

The app now have:
- An auth (login/logout)
- Blog post index (where people can view all posts)
- Blog post page (the page where the complete post can be viewed)
- A partly finished Dashboard (where an author can manage his/her blog posts)

I was not that unproductive after all!

## What next?

I'll stop there for today. I'll try to come to work tomorrow. I just hope my condition doesn't get worse.

I'll have to continue working on the app over the weekend aside from my client projects. :)

Stay tuned for more.
