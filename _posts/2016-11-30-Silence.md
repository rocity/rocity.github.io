Every morning, I sit down on a monobloc chair, legs crossed, sipping my coffee.
Half an hour without saying a single word. A friend is still bewildered as of how I can bear such an ordeal.

In this half-hour, I feel the best of my own world. Every single thing in my mind is as clear as the April skies. Every errand, meeting, responsibility, and knick-knack are being mentally organized in that 30-minute window. Effortlessly.

Not all, do hear the silence's call. Its whispers of tranquility and calmness.
It is for us to listen.
